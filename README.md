Certainly! Here's a section of a README file that provides instructions on how to set up and run the project using Poetry:

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with the Project

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have **Python 3.7 or newer** installed. You can check this by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), a dependency management and packaging tool. Follow the [official installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for your operating system.

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Start a new shell with the virtual environment**:
   If you're not already using a virtual environment (like `venv` or `virtualenv`), Poetry will create one for you. To activate this environment, start a new shell with:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   Within the virtual environment, use the following command to install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

### Running the Project

After setting up, you can run the project (assuming it's a Streamlit app, for example) with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Make sure to adjust the placeholder URLs (`your-username`, `your-repository-name`) and file names (`app.py`) as needed. This README section provides a standard way to guide users to set up a Python project managed by Poetry.






streamlit run uber_pickups.py

Here's a brief breakdown of what each part does:

FROM python:3.8-slim-buster: This sets the base image. In this case, we're using Python 3.8 on a slim version of Buster (a Debian variant).
WORKDIR /app: This sets the working directory inside the container. All the commands following this instruction will be executed in this directory.
COPY . /app: This copies the current directory (where your app resides) into the container.
RUN pip install...: This installs the necessary Python packages.
EXPOSE 8501: This exposes port 8501 on the container. Streamlit by default runs on this port.
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]: This tells Docker to run the command to start your Streamlit app when the container starts.


Build the Docker image by running: docker build -t uber_pickups .
sudo docker build -t uber_pickups .

Once the image is built, you can run it with: 
sudo docker run -p 8501:8501 uber_pickups
